# Weather App

This is a weather application built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It's my first project using Next.js, and I'm excited to share it with you!

## Overview

The application provides real-time weather data for various locations. It displays the current temperature, UV index, hourly forecast, and a weekly forecast. It also includes a map component to visualize the location of the weather data and a small news widget.

## Features

- **Current Temperature**: Displays the current temperature of a location.
- **UV Index**: Shows the maximum UV index for the day.
- **Hourly Forecast**: Provides an hourly weather forecast.
- **Weekly Forecast**: Gives a weekly weather forecast.
- **Country News**: Shows a headling of the country the selected city is situated in.
- **Map**: Visualizes the location of the weather data.

## Technologies Used
